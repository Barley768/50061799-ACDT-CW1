    Instructions
    Demonstrate APIs and associated documentation
        You are a junior data analyst at a multi-faceted management/deployment company that is exploring how freely available APIs can enhance its operations, customer engagement, or decision-making. Your manager has asked you to create a Python script that connects to at least four public API, retrieves relevant data, and demonstrates how this data can be used to benefit the business.

        Objectives:
        Understand how to access and consume public APIs using Python.
        Demonstrate the practical business applications of API data.
        Present insights or functionality that could support business goals (e.g., marketing, logistics, customer service, finance).
        Requirements:
        API Selection:
        Choose freely available APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, CoinGecko, Google Books, REST Countries, etc.).
        Justify your choice based on a business use case.
        Python Script:
        Use requests or another suitable library to connect to the API.
        Retrieve and process the data (e.g., filtering, formatting, basic analysis).
        Include error handling for failed requests or missing data.
        Business Use Case Demonstration:
        Show how the data can be used in a business context.
        Examples: 
        Weather data to optimize delivery routes.
        News data to monitor industry trends.
        Cryptocurrency prices for financial planning.
        Book data for market research in publishing.
        Documentation:
        Industry level of expected associated documentation.
        Advanced:
        Visualise the data using libraries like matplotlib or plotly.
        Use multiple APIs to combine their data for richer insights.

        Note: To protect application environments from bots or malicious access attempts, most APIs rate limit availability. If you make a large number of the same API calls, your API call may be blocked for a specific amount of time. The timeout is usually less than 5 minutes.

    Management Report Documentation
        Using your Python solution from Part 1 as an example, produce a report for a multi-faceted management/deployment company why the use of APIs in automating parsing and serialising can boost monitoring management, deployment, functionality, customer experience and service levels as part of a DevOps environment. 
        In this report discuss speed, security, consistency and how they would benefit from the use of stand-alone APIs and containers.

        Note: A multi-faceted management/deployment company is a provider that offers a wide range of services to deploy, manage, and support complex IT solutions across multiple environments. These companies handle IT infrastructure, multi-cloud environments, device deployment, and data management, often providing both strategic planning and hands-on implementation and ongoing support along with logistics, forecast planning, real-time delivery/package tracking.
